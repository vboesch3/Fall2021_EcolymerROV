  <description brief="A base class for an ActuatorArrayDriver node">
    <p>	
	This package contains a base class for an Actuator Array Driver. This is intended for use with chains of R/C Servos or other
	similar devices where position (and velocity) commands are sent at irregular intervals, as opposed to the tight, real-time
	control loop of the <a href="http://www.ros.org/wiki/pr2_controller_manager">PR2 Controller Manager</a> system. 
    </p>
    <p>
    This base class performs some standard functionality, such as parsing joint limits out of the robot_description, subscribing to 
    a 'command' topic, publishing on the 'joint_states' topic, and setting up a 'stop' and 'home' service call. This is designed to 
    work as a stand-alone driver for controlling/tele-operating a chain of servos, or in conjunction with the 
    <a href="http://www.ros.org/wiki/actuator_array_joint_trajectory_action">Actuator Array Joint Trajectory Action</a>. However, this is 
    provided as a convenience only, and is not required for successful operation with the Actuator Array Joint Trajectory Action.
